Meanwhile, huge thanks to [@slevithan](https://github.com/slevithan)'s great work on [`oniguruma-to-es`](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-to-es) that make the [JavaScript engine supports 97.2% of all the languages](/references/engine-js-compat).

## Breaking Changes

There are **NO** hard breaking changes in v2.0.0. It serves as a stepping stone for the upcoming v3.0.0.

The only change in v2 is that Shiki will now **emit warnings when you are using APIs that are deprecated** and planned to be removed in v3. As this might affect the end users, we make a major version bump so you can opt-in to the warnings and prepare for the future removal.

- `v1.x`: Deprecated APIs are still supported, marked on type level only. With optional runtime warnings to opt-in.
- 👉 `v2.0`: No breaking changes, but enable runtime deprecated warnings by default.
- `v3.0`: Remove deprecated APIs, breaking changes.

Expect v3.0.0 to be released soon after v2.0.0.

## Deprecations

We highly recommend you to migrate them sooner.

### `getHighlighter` -> `createHighlighter`

There is no functional changes, but more like correcting the naming to avoid confusion. It should be a straightforward find-and-replace.

### WASM Related APIs

Since the introduce of the [engine system](/guide/regex-engines) in v0.16, the WebAssembly related dependencies are no longer a hard requirement. To make tree-shaking easier and decoupled the engines with the core, two packages are extracted `@shikijs/engine-oniguruma` and `@shikijs/engine-javascript`. They are also re-exported from the main package's `shiki/engine/oniguruma` and `shiki/engine/javascript` respectively.

You might need to change your import path:

```ts
import { loadWasm } from 'shiki' // [!code --]
import { loadWasm } from 'shiki/engine/oniguruma' // [!code ++]
```

`loadWasm` field in `createHighlighterCore` is replaced with `engine` field:

```ts
import { createHighlighter } from 'shiki'
import { createOnigurumaEngine } from 'shiki/engine/oniguruma' // [!code ++]

const shiki = await createHighlighter({
  // ...
  loadWasm: () => import('shiki/wasm'), // [!code --]
  engine: createOnigurumaEngine(() => import('shiki/wasm')), // [!code ++]
})
```

### Shiki Compat

The `@shikijs/compat` package that built for compatibility with v0.14 is now deprecated. Please migrate to the main package. This package will be removed in v3.0.

### Transformers Matching Algorithm

The `matchAlgorithm` option for transformers is introduced in v1.29.0 to allow users to choose the matching algorithm. The default value will be changed from `v1` to `v3` in v3.0.0. We recommend you to set the `matchAlgorithm` option explicitly to avoid breaking changes in the future.

[Learn more](/packages/transformers#matching-algorithm).

### Other Deprecations

- `createdBundledHighlighter` requires a single object-style argument
- `@shikijs/core`
  - The regex engines `createJavaScriptRegexEngine` `createOnigurumaEngine` are no longer included, import them from `@shikijs/engine-oniguruma` and `@shikijs/engine-javascript` respectively
  - `createHighlighterCore` now explicits requires an `engine` field to be passed
  - `loadWasm` field in `createHighlighterCore` is replaced with `engine` field
  - `@shikijs/core/wasm-inline` is replaced with `@shikijs/engine-oniguruma/wasm-inline`
  - Import `FontStyle` and `StackElementMetadata` from `@shikijs/vscode-textmate` instead of `@shikijs/core`

## Tweaking Warnings

If you prepre hard errors instead of warnings, you can run the following code before using Shiki, the first argument decides if warnings should be enabled, the second argument decides if warnings should be thrown as errors:

```ts
import { enableDeprecationWarnings } from 'shiki/core'

enableDeprecationWarnings(true, true) // enable warnings and throw errors

// use crateHighlighter(...) etc. after that
```

### Disable Warnings

If you want to disable the warnings:

```ts
import { enableDeprecationWarnings } from 'shiki/core'

enableDeprecationWarnings(false)
```

## Try It as a User

If you are using Shiki indirectly via other packages, like [`vitepress`](https://vitepress.dev/) or [`@nuxt/content`](https://content.nuxt.com/), etc. Where you don't directly control the version of Shiki, you can try adding the following lines to you `package.json` to force the usage of Shiki v2.0.0, and to check if the frameworks/tools you are using are using deprecated APIs of Shiki - if they do, report to their repositories and bring them the awareness of the upcoming changes. Thanks!

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "shiki": "^2",
    "@shikijs/core": "^2",
    "@shikijs/transformers": "^2",
    "@shikijs/markdown-it": "^2",
    "@shikijs/rehype": "^2"
  }
}
```
